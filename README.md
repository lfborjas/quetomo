#Qu√© Tomo

If you tend to self-medicate, at least be smart about it by looking your medications up on this crowdsourced repository.

This was developed as part of the [Global Datafest 2015 in Tegucigalpa](www.global.datafest.net/cities/tegucigalpa). Find more info in the [project page](http://www.global.datafest.net/a/datafest.net/globalurbandatafest/projects/que-tomo).

## For developers

This application is built on [meteor](https://www.meteor.com). To run it, you need to [install meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/quickstart). And when that's done, just run `meteor` within this app's directory, the application should be running on localhost:3000. 

If you intend to improve upon this, feel free to fork and send me a pull request.
